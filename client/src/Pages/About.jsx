        About Us Welcome to the Peer Help Platform – a collaborative academic
        support system built by students, for students. Our mission is to foster
        a culture of mutual learning, where students can seek help with
        assignments, projects, and concepts directly from their peers. Our
        platform is exclusive to university students, ensuring a trusted and
        secure environment. Every user is verified through their university ID,
        and all interactions are guided by respect, academic integrity, and
        shared growth. We believe that the best learning happens through
        teaching others. That’s why every student can choose to be a helper, a
        learner – or both. With features like question and answer posting,
        voting, messaging, and interest-based matching, we aim to make academic
        support accessible, authentic, and impactful. Together, we're not just
        solving problems – we're building a stronger, smarter community
